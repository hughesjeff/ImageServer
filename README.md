#Welcome to Jeff's TensorFlow Playground!

This is just for me to play around with. It is designed to run on Ubuntu 16.04 and derivatives.

It requires TensorFlow to be installed with pip system-wide. It also requires Cuda, as the libs in this repo are the Linux x64 GPU-enabled ones. You can follow the directions [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) to install everything needed.
